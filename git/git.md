### General Workflow..

1. Fetch and merge changes from the remote
2. Create a branch to work on a new project feature
3. Develop the feature on your branch and commit your work
4. Fetch and merge from the remote again (in case new commits were made while you were working)
5. Push your branch up to the remote for review

1. **Commit Object**
    1. Is a small text file

### Git IDs

* A git ID is the name of a git object

* Stored as a 40-char hex string

* Often displayed as only the first 7 characters

* You may use the first few ID chars (min 4) in git so long as it is unique within the repository

* Uses SHA1 algorithm

* Can manually compute a SHA1 for a file with..

>git hash-object *file*

#### git help gitcmd
>Displays in-depth help

#### git gitcmd -h
>Displays command line syntax only

#### git init
> Creates a new Git repository

#### git status

#### git add
>Stages files from the working directory to the staging area

#### git diff

#### git show HEAD
>Display everything the git log command displays for the HEAD commit, plus all the file changes that were committed.

#### git checkout HEAD
>Will OVERWRITE any changes to the local file and retrieve the most recent committed version from the repository.

#### git checkout branchname
>Changes current working branch to branchname

#### git reset HEAD filename
>This command resets the file in the staging area to be the same as the HEAD commit. It does not discard file changes from the working directory, it just removes them from the staging area.

#### git reset SHA
>Resets to a previous commit identified by the first 7 digits of its SHA from 'git log'. Conceptually..

              Before reset..

              [A] ------ [B] ------ [HEAD]

#### git branch
>Displays the branch upon which you're currently working

#### git branch branchname
>Creates a new branch

#### git branch -d branchname
>Deletes an old branch

#### git merge branchname
>Merges changes from branchname into the current working branch.

#### git clone remote local
>Makes a local copy of a remote branch

#### get remote -v
>Lists the known remotes of the files in the current working repository. Each file listed at least twice - once as a fetch, the other as a push.

#### git fetch
>Retrieve any changes that may have been made to the clone's origin. Changed files are placed in a REMOTE BRANCH.

#### git push origin localbr
>Pushes your local changes to the branch specified by 'origin'.

#### git config
>Get and set repository or global options.

>>--system: apply command to every repository for every user on current system.

>>--local: applies only to the current repository (highest precedence).

#### git config core.editor <editor>
>Set editor for git operations requiring an editor

#### Create a new repository from command line

    echo "# reposC" >> README.md
    git init
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git remote add origin https://github.com/bobbyers1111/reposC.git
    git push -u origin master

    â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line

    git remote add origin https://github.com/bobbyers1111/reposC.git
    git push -u origin master
